 web application is similar to Medium, a popular platform for writers and readers. Medium allows users to create, publish, and read articles on various topics, as well as comment and interact with other users. To build a web application like Medium, you will need to consider the following features and requirements:

Authentication: You will need to allow users to sign up and log in to your web application using their email and password, or using a third-party service like Google or Facebook. You will also need to implement authorization logic to restrict access to certain features based on the user’s role and permissions. For example, only logged-in users can write and comment on articles, and only the author of an article can edit or delete it.
Blogging: You will need to provide a user interface for users to write and edit articles using a rich text editor. You will also need to allow users to add images, videos, links, tags, and other metadata to their articles. You will need to store the articles and their associated data in a database, such as MongoDB, and retrieve them using queries. You will also need to implement pagination, sorting, filtering, and searching functionalities for displaying the articles on the web page.
Commenting: You will need to enable users to comment on articles and reply to other comments. You will also need to allow users to like, dislike, report, or delete comments. You will need to store the comments and their associated data in a database, such as MongoDB, and retrieve them using queries. You will also need to implement pagination, sorting, filtering, and searching functionalities for displaying the comments on the web page.
Notifications: You will need to notify users of various events, such as new articles, comments, likes, followers, etc. You will need to use a service like Pusher or Firebase to send real-time notifications to the users’ browsers. You will also need to use a service like OneSignal or Firebase to send push notifications to the users’ devices, if they have installed your PWA as an app.
PWA: You will need to make your web application a PWA by adding a manifest file and a service worker. A manifest file is a JSON file that contains information about your web application, such as its name, icon, theme color, orientation, etc. A service worker is a JavaScript file that runs in the background and handles caching, offline support, background sync, and push notifications. You will need to use a tool like Workbox or PWA Builder to generate and register your service worker.
To build your web application, you will need to use a web framework, such as Express.js, to handle the server-side logic and routing. Express.js is a minimalist and flexible web framework for Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server. You will also need to use a templating engine, such as EJS, to render dynamic HTML pages based on the data from the database. EJS is a simple and fast templating engine that lets you embed JavaScript code in HTML tags. You will also need to use other small libraries, such as Mongoose, Passport, and Validator, to simplify the tasks of working with MongoDB, implementing authentication, and validating user input, respectively.
